This Makefile can be used to download various UK shapefiles and convert them to geojson and topojson formats. Currently we have:

- UK boundary.
- UK wards.
- England and Wales OAs, LSOAs and MSOAs.
- Scottish Datazones (equivalent to LSOAs) and Intermediate zones (MSOAs).
- England, Wales and Scotland postal areas and postal districts.
- England, Wales and Scotland counties and bouroughs.
- Ordnance Survey Boundary Line shapefiles.
- English Green Belt 2011 regions.

Run 'make all' to produce them.
